# \<MemeMachine\>
## Make your very own memes!

### How it Works
- \<MemeMachine\> comes in 3 different editions, Web, Chrome Extension, and Desktop Edition.
- In \<MemeMachine\>, you can edit both the top and bottom text, as well as customize the style; you can edit the font size, outline size, and add or remove borders to the top of text.
- In all editions of \<MemeMachine\>, a file choose option is available, so that you can choose a local file from you computer as your meme image. However, in the Chrome Extension Edition, the option of click'n'boom is added, which lets you click on an image in a website and make it your meme image.

### The Code
- In all editions, \<MemeMachine\> is coded **Purely** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, & Java.
- To help with our design, Ionicons, a modern CSS3 icon font, powers **All** of our icons.
